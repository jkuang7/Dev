## HARDENED: STORY-03 (Xactware Agent Portal) ✅

### Context (Rich — For Downstream Understanding + Blog Export)

**Problem**: Xactware migration stalled at 1-year estimate. SSO portal for insurance agents to access vendor system. Previous engineer couldn't make progress.

**Why It Mattered**: $200K+ SLA penalties if portal unavailable. 7.1M annual requests from agents. Business-critical for underwriting workflow.

**Key Nuances**:
- SSO bridge using form POST requests to vendor system
- Had to reverse-engineer legacy Spring Boot without docs
- Multi-region failover required (US-East/US-West) for SLA
- Jim Buckley as TA for validation
- Junior engineer (Zahid) available but needed mentoring
- Stand-ups were time sinks, opted for async deep work
- OAuth/MFA requirement with Azure — had to flush out claims, tokens, API Gateway authorizer
- API Gateway needed authorizer to verify user validity before accessing service

**Resolution Flow**:
1. Converted entire old project into a PRD document — broke down full flow and expectations
2. Got buy-in from TAs (Jim Buckley, others) who understood business flows
3. Used PRD as contract to get agreement from manager and stakeholders
4. Spoke to old engineers who owned legacy project to understand E2E flow
5. Made sure 80-90% of main edge cases were covered based on scaffold
6. Built from clean slate — scaffolded React/TypeScript from scratch
7. Borrowed Terraform modules from NBUS project (reuse infra)
8. Worked with staff engineer to validate architecture — flushed out OAuth/MFA/Azure requirements
9. Back-and-forth locked down final architecture BEFORE starting implementation
10. Mentored junior (Zahid) to work in parallel — split tasks, no overlap
11. Built multi-region failover with chaos engineering
12. Skipped tests, focused on E2E flow working
13. Added docs + deploy warnings as cheap guardrails

**Retrospective**: Process worked well. The upfront PRD and architecture validation protected the project and made estimation accurate. Would do it the same way again.

### Refined (Translated — For Interview Use)

**Hook**: Took over stalled migration, shipped multi-region SSO portal in 4-6 months
**Blog Hook**: A stalled migration, $200K in SLA penalties on the line, and a previous engineer who couldn't crack it
**Blog Candidate**: yes
**Supports Bullets**: B-01

**Skeleton STAR**:
- S: Stalled migration, 1-year estimate, $200K SLA risk
- T: Ship SSO portal, enable failover
- A: Cut scope, scaffolded React, mentored junior, chaos tested
- R: 7.1M requests, $200K saved, 4-6 months

**Core Insight**: I unblock stalled projects by cutting scope ruthlessly and shipping fast.

**Question Triggers**:
- "Tell me about a time you took over a struggling project"
- "How do you handle ambiguity?"
- "Describe a time you shipped under pressure"

**Answer Versions**:

**1-Line**: Took over stalled migration, cut scope from 1 year to 4 months, shipped multi-region portal handling 7M+ requests.

**2-Minute**: Inherited a project that was behind and chaotic. Previous estimate: 1 year. I broke tasks into musts vs nice-to-haves, leveraged existing Terraform modules, used AI to understand the legacy code. Mentored a junior to work in parallel while I handled scaffolding and deployment. Shipped a React/TypeScript SSO bridge for insurance agents. Built multi-region failover — when AWS East went down, West stayed up, avoided SLA penalties. Tradeoff: skipped tests, focused on E2E flow working.

**Follow-Ups**:
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| More time? | Abstract Terraform into shared repo |
| Previous engineer? | Project needed restructuring, focused on deadline |
| Why no tests? | Flaky for React, requirements changing, would add integration tests after |
| How 4-6 months? | Broke down tasks, understood costs, leveraged existing work |
| AWS outage? | West stayed up, failover worked |

## HARDENED: STORY-05 (Blue/Green Deploys) ✅

### Context (Rich — For Downstream Understanding)

**Problem**: Rolling deploys caused outages during cloud migrations. Cutover latency was P99 4.77s — users experienced downtime during every deploy.

**Why It Mattered**: Company-wide outages were damaging trust. Developer velocity suffered because deploys were risky. All 4 apps needed a better strategy.

**Key Nuances**:
- Blue/green: two envs, test on green, instant traffic switch
- ROSA (Red Hat OpenShift on AWS) framework available
- Team leads: Abit, Vijaya, me. Manager: Jessi
- Had to influence without authority — couldn't mandate, had to demo value
- Cost concern: second env costs, but minimal (storage only during idle)

**Resolution Flow**:
1. Saw outages across company during cloud migrations
2. Implemented blue/green on PBRI first as proof of concept
3. Demoed to manager (Jessi) and key engineers (Chanana, Ron)
4. Got manager sponsorship → she pushed in team meeting
5. Provided ROSA framework resources, made myself available for questions
6. Team leads adopted it, trained their engineers
7. All 4 apps migrated to blue/green

**Retrospective**: Demo approach worked well — built it, showed the value, got sponsorship. No major regrets.

### Refined (Translated — For Interview Use)

**Hook**: Pushed blue/green adoption, cut deploy latency P99 4.77s→150ms
**Blog Hook**: Every deploy was a gamble — 4.77 seconds of downtime while users watched loading spinners
**Blog Candidate**: yes
**Supports Bullets**: B-03, B-04

**Skeleton STAR**:
- S: Rolling deploys causing outages, P99 4.77s
- T: Get team to adopt blue/green
- A: Built POC on PBRI, demoed to manager, got sponsorship
- R: P99 150ms, all 4 apps migrated

**Core Insight**: I influence without authority by showing value first, then getting sponsorship.

**Question Triggers**:
- "Tell me about a time you influenced without authority"
- "How do you drive adoption of new practices?"
- "Describe a technical decision you led"

**Answer Versions**:

**1-Line**: Pushed blue/green adoption across team, cut deploy cutover latency from 4.77s to 150ms.

**2-Minute**: After seeing outages across the company during cloud migrations, I implemented blue/green on PBRI as a proof of concept. Demoed to my manager and key engineers — showed the value: test on green, instant cutover, easy rollback. Got manager buy-in, she pushed it in a team meeting. I provided ROSA framework resources, made myself available for questions. Team leads adopted it for their projects and trained their engineers. Result: P99 cutover latency dropped from 4.77s to 150ms.

**Follow-Ups**:
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why not write docs? | Demo was faster, teams could figure out implementation details |
| Any resistance? | No — once manager sponsored it, team leads adopted it |
| What if someone didn't use ROSA? | Pointed them to Terraform approach, let them figure it out |
| How did you measure P99? | ROSA/OpenShift metrics during cutover window |

## HARDENED: STORY-02 (NBUS Architecture) ✅

### Context (Rich — For Downstream Understanding)

**Problem**: IBM BPM migration — monolith where you couldn't touch one piece without breaking another. DIY surveys for insurance, distributed state machine needed.

**Why It Mattered**: 10K daily requests. Vendor responses were async, needed waiting states. Multiple engineers had to work in parallel without blocking.

**Key Nuances**:
- AWS Step Functions for distributed state machine
- Master state pattern: pass full state, destructure, update, return merged
- Team leads: Abit, Vijaya. Junior: James. Entry: Zahid
- Needed living documentation to keep architecture current
- TypeScript for type safety on data contracts between Steps
- SQS queues for async vendor response handling

**Resolution Flow**:
1. Used IBM Integration Designer to map legacy flows
2. Designed master state pattern for divide-and-conquer
3. Built skeleton architecture, let team leads own parallel tracks
4. Created Migration Runbook on main branch — PRs required to update it
5. "Measure twice, cut once": internal meeting with leads first, got buy-in
6. Presented strategy to whole team after leads aligned
7. Created tickets with clear definition of done based on mapping
8. Taught engineers how to read tickets → map to their Step Function
9. Lead engineers (me, Abit, Vijaya) were escalation points for discrepancies
10. Centralized ticket ownership to Abit for single source of truth
11. 5 engineers worked in parallel, shipped 6 months early

**Retrospective**: Upfront mapping investment paid off. Clear tickets with definition of done prevented confusion. No major regrets — process worked.

### Refined (Translated — For Interview Use)

**Hook**: Designed divide-and-conquer architecture for IBM BPM migration, shipped 6 months early
**Blog Hook**: Five engineers, one monolith, and no way to work in parallel without breaking everything
**Blog Candidate**: yes
**Supports Bullets**: B-01, B-05

**Skeleton STAR**:
- S: IBM BPM monolith, can't parallelize work
- T: Enable 5 engineers to work without blocking
- A: Master state pattern, skeleton arch, living docs
- R: 6 months early, 10K daily requests

**Core Insight**: I unblock ambiguity with first-principles architecture and living documentation.

**Question Triggers**:
- "Tell me about a time you led a technical migration"
- "How do you handle ambiguity?"
- "Describe a time you enabled team parallelism"

**Answer Versions**:

**1-Line**: Designed divide-and-conquer architecture for IBM BPM migration, enabled 5 engineers to work in parallel, shipped 6 months early.

**2-Minute**: IBM BPM was a monolith — you couldn't touch one piece without breaking another. I designed a master state pattern: each Step Function receives full state, destructures what it needs, updates its piece, returns the merged state. This let engineers work on different Steps without stepping on each other. I built the skeleton, then let team leads own their tracks. Created a Migration Runbook on main branch — PRs required to update it, so it stayed current. Met with leads first to get buy-in, then presented the strategy to the whole team. Centralized ticket ownership to Abit so there was one source of truth. Result: 5 engineers working in parallel, shipped 6 months early.

**Follow-Ups**:
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why Step Functions? | Waiting states for vendor responses, state snapshots for debugging, test Steps in isolation |
| Why centralize tickets? | Single source of truth, avoided duplicate work and confusion |
| How did you get buy-in? | Met with leads first, showed the architecture, addressed concerns, then presented together to team |
| What if someone didn't follow the pattern? | PRs required to update Runbook — code review caught deviations |
| What was the hardest part? | Getting the state contract right upfront — once that was stable, parallel work flowed |

## HARDENED: STORY-08 (Data Pipeline Memory Fix) ✅

### Context (Rich — For Downstream Understanding)

**Problem**: ETL pipeline for SMS campaign analytics crashing on large files. Memory would spike and never come down. Tier 1 clients sending 20GB Excel files.

**Why It Mattered**: Business analytics team couldn't analyze subscription trends for enterprise clients. Campaigns couldn't be refined without this data. Pipeline was blocking revenue optimization.

**Key Nuances**:
- Python ETL script containerized with Airflow
- 15-min deploy cycles made debugging expensive
- Couldn't replicate S3 bucket locally
- Bug looked like normal file loading — hard to spot in code review
- Had to aggregate rows for analytics team downstream
- Issue only surfaced with large files (tier 1 clients)

**Resolution Flow**:
1. Noticed memory spike only occurred with large files
2. Suspected file ingestion code but 15-min deploys made testing expensive
3. Copied offending code portion, ran locally with actual file
4. Found bug: loading entire file into memory instead of streaming
5. Fixed with batch streaming — load rows X to Y, process, next block
6. Before/after memory comparison proved 98% reduction
7. Deployed fix, pipeline stable for 20GB files

**Retrospective**: Edge case only surfaced with tier 1 client file sizes. Would ask upfront: "Does it work for extremely large files? Very small files?" — test varying file sizes as part of validation.

### Refined (Translated — For Interview Use)

**Hook**: Debugged memory-hogging ETL pipeline, achieved 50× lighter memory footprint
**Blog Hook**: 20GB Excel files, a pipeline that kept crashing, and 15-minute deploy cycles that made every guess expensive
**Blog Candidate**: yes
**Supports Bullets**: B-09

**Skeleton STAR**:
- S: ETL pipeline crashing on 20GB files, 15-min debug cycles
- T: Find and fix memory bug
- A: Isolated code locally, found full-file load bug, batch streamed
- R: 98% memory reduction (50× lighter)

**Core Insight**: If something isn't testable, make it testable. First-principle thinking beats expensive deploy cycles.

**Question Triggers**:
- "Walk me through the hardest bug you've solved"
- "Tell me about a time you debugged a production issue"
- "How do you approach problems that are hard to reproduce?"

**Answer Versions**:

**1-Line**: Debugged ETL pipeline memory bug by isolating code locally, fixed with batch streaming, 98% memory reduction.

**2-Minute**: Enterprise clients were sending 20GB Excel files for SMS campaign analytics. Pipeline kept crashing — memory would spike and never come down. Hard to debug: 15-minute Airflow deploy cycles, couldn't replicate S3 locally. I suspected the file ingestion code. Copied just that portion, ran it locally with an actual file. Found the bug: loading entire file into memory instead of streaming. Fix was batch streaming — load rows X to Y, process, move to next block. Before/after comparison showed 98% memory reduction. Lesson: if something isn't testable, make it testable. First-principle thinking.

**Follow-Ups**:
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| How did you pick batch size? | Tuned empirically — small enough for memory safety, large enough for throughput |
| Why not row-by-row? | Too slow for 20GB files. Batching balanced speed and memory |
| How did you measure 98%? | Before/after memory profiling on same file |
| Why was original code loading full file? | Bug — looked like streaming but was accumulating in memory |
| Could you have caught this in code review? | Hard to spot — code looked like normal file loading, issue only surfaced with large files |

## Interview Tips

**Do**:
- Lead with the win, then explain how
- Use specific numbers (not "improved" or "various")
- Say "I" for your work, clarify team contributions separately

**Don't**:
- Trash colleagues ("project needed restructuring" not "he was entry-level")
- Trash leadership ("cost concerns at higher levels")
- Say "helped with" / "worked on" — say what you did

**Know**:
- Blue/green: two envs, instant traffic switch
- Rolling: gradual instance replacement
- Canary: small % traffic to new version first

**Defend**:
- 99.9% uptime: "After initial deployment stabilization — early phase had expected issues as we learned the prod environment. Once stable, maintained 99.9%."
- 40M+ requests: FIMS (34M) + Xactware (7.1M) + NBUS (3.6M) = ~45M. Source doc says 40M+.
