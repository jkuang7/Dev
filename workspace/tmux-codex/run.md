# Runner Prompt Contract

The runner control plane is fully decoupled into three prompts:

1. `/prompts:run_setup`
2. `/prompts:run_execute`
3. `/prompts:run_govern`

`cl -> r=runner` must always start with `/prompts:run_execute`.
It dispatches `/prompts:run_govern` in the same live session when execute explicitly requests semantic task-state changes or when scripted refresh cannot produce the prepared marker and the current model profile is already compatible. Otherwise it relaunches a fresh session for the required update profile.

## Minimal User Flow

From inside the target repo or active worktree:

1. `/prompts:run_setup`
2. approve enablement if setup returns a token
3. start the runner from `cl` / TUI with `r=runner`

Runner start is intentionally decoupled:
- `r=runner` is launch-only
- it must not run setup
- it must not clear state
- it must not auto-approve enablement
- if setup is missing or not approved, it must fail fast and tell the user to run `/prompts:run_setup`

## Prompt Ownership

- `/prompts:run_setup`
  - clear-then-setup on normal setup runs
  - setup-only on `--approve-enable <token>` reruns
  - creates fresh runner state and a deliberately narrow backlog
  - human reset/rebuild path
  - tmux-codex runtime must not dispatch this autonomously
  - may return an enable approval token
- `/prompts:run_execute`
  - execute-only worker prompt
  - one medium bounded phase iteration
  - validate the active surface
  - terminate the session
- `/prompts:run_govern`
  - semantic post-execute governor prompt
  - used when execute reported task-state changes that need modeled rewriting or when scripted refresh could not hand off the next cycle
  - performs in-place backlog repair without wiping runner memory
  - treats `OBJECTIVE.json`, `SEAMS.json`, and `GAPS.json` as the runtime bundle
  - terminate the session

Deprecated:
- `/run`
  - removed from the normal runner flow
  - retained only as a temporary migration alias while old sessions age out

## Non-Negotiables

- Single runner id: `main`
- Source of truth:
  - `<target-root>/.memory/runner/runtime/RUNNER_STATE.json`
  - `<target-root>/.memory/runner/OBJECTIVE.json`
  - `<target-root>/.memory/runner/SEAMS.json`
  - `<target-root>/.memory/runner/GAPS.json`
  - `<target-root>/.memory/runner/RUNNER_PARITY.json`
- Prepared handoff marker:
  - `<target-root>/.memory/runner/runtime/RUNNER_CYCLE_PREPARED.json`
- Audit log:
  - `<target-root>/.memory/runner/runtime/RUNNER_LEDGER.ndjson`
- Scope first:
  - wrong root means wrong context and wrong edits

## Root Resolution

`runctl` resolves target root in this order:

1. explicit `--project-root <abs-path>`
2. `$DEV/Repos/<project>/.memory/RUNNER_CONTEXT.json`
3. saved runner state discovery (worktree preferred)
4. `$DEV/Repos/<project>`

## Setup / Clear

Advanced CLI equivalents:

```bash
python3 /Users/jian/Dev/workspace/tmux-codex/bin/runctl --clear --project-root "$PWD" --runner-id main
python3 /Users/jian/Dev/workspace/tmux-codex/bin/runctl --clear --project-root "$PWD" --runner-id main --confirm <CLEAR_TOKEN>
python3 /Users/jian/Dev/workspace/tmux-codex/bin/runctl --setup --project-root "$PWD" --runner-id main
python3 /Users/jian/Dev/workspace/tmux-codex/bin/runctl --setup --project-root "$PWD" --runner-id main --approve-enable <ENABLE_TOKEN>
```

Setup requirements:
- when setup is invoked without `--approve-enable`, first clear existing runner-managed state via the two-phase clear flow
- if `PRD.json` / `TASKS.json` are missing, generic, or stale for the current request, seed fresh concrete files before running setup
- for migrations, refactors, and parity-sensitive UI work, seed `RUNNER_PARITY.json` with one explicit safe baseline commit plus the smallest truthful audited surface set
- use the latest explicit user request as the source of truth for the seeded objective and bounded tasks
- seeded tasks must be narrow enough for one bounded runner slice; do not seed umbrella tasks when the request already names smaller concrete surfaces
- seeded tasks should be concise and decoupled: one primary family, one seam, one validation path, and explicit blocked follow-ons for the rest
- for dependency-heavy migrations, `run_setup` is the strong planning gate: it should split work by file family, safe deprecation phase, and dependency containment before the infinite runner starts
- `run_setup` should score slice construction in this order: dependency correctness, deprecation sequencing, decoupling, independent executability, then smallest valid complexity
- `/run_setup` is intentionally reset-oriented: it may clear and regenerate memory files from repo state plus conversation context
- seeded active tasks should carry `model_profile`, `profile_reason`, `touch_paths`, `validation_commands`, `deprecation_phase`, `fanout_risk`, and optional `spillover_paths`
- risky migration/refactor tasks should also carry `parity_baseline_ref`, `parity_surface_ids`, `parity_audit_mode`, and optional `parity_harness_commands`
- refresh `.memory/runner/*`
- refresh `RUNNER_EXEC_CONTEXT.json`
- refresh `RUNNER_ACTIVE_BACKLOG.json`
- refresh graph artifacts when repo graph support is enabled:
  - `.memory/runner/graph/RUNNER_DEP_GRAPH.json`
  - `.memory/runner/graph/RUNNER_GRAPH_ACTIVE_SLICE.json`
  - `.memory/runner/graph/RUNNER_GRAPH_BOUNDARIES.json`
  - `.memory/runner/graph/RUNNER_GRAPH_HOTSPOTS.json`
- keep `active_seam_id`, `next_task_id`, and `next_task` aligned with the prepared seam frontier
- when graph support is enabled, default to a one-open actionable frontier unless the plan intentionally permits parallel starts
- write `RUNNER_HANDOFF.md`

Clear requirements:
- remove runner-managed state safely
- remove `RUNNER_HANDOFF.md`
- remove `.memory/PRD.md`
- remove legacy `REFRACTOR_STATUS.md` if present

## Execute Contract

`/prompts:run_execute` is the default prompt `r=runner` should drive each cycle.
`/prompts:run_govern` is conditional and should run only when semantic refresh is required.
`/prompts:run_setup` is for human reset/rebuild only.

`/prompts:run_execute` must:
- read `.memory/runner/runtime/RUNNER_STATE.json`
- read `RUNNER_EXEC_CONTEXT.json`
- read `RUNNER_ACTIVE_BACKLOG.json`
- optionally read `.memory/runner/graph/RUNNER_GRAPH_ACTIVE_SLICE.json`
- rely on `graph_slice_reason` in exec context as the compact explanation of why this exact cluster/seam is the current frontier
- use `parity_baseline_ref` plus targeted `parity_surface_ids` to keep UI/UX parity audits diff-first and small
- resolve phase from explicit `PHASE` or exec context
- work only within the current phase goal and one coherent medium slice
- keep the slice small enough that a second independent family would be a scope failure, but detailed enough that the next step is obvious from metadata alone
- treat `RUNNER_HANDOFF.md` as human/manual recovery context rather than default per-cycle input
- keep full graph artifacts off the hot path; normal execute cycles must not load `RUNNER_DEP_GRAPH.json`, `RUNNER_GRAPH_BOUNDARIES.json`, or `RUNNER_GRAPH_HOTSPOTS.json`
- do not run broad parity audits every cycle; diff the slice against the safe baseline first, then use targeted MCP reads on only the affected declared surfaces
- treat medium slices as execution chunks while keeping the same active seam until its acceptance is fully satisfied
- strengthen the active seam contract when new in-scope acceptance criteria are discovered instead of silently carrying hidden requirements
- avoid setup/clear behavior
- terminate immediately

`/prompts:run_govern` must:
- repair semantic backlog state in `SEAMS.json` / `GAPS.json` and only touch objective wording when objective-level intent truly changes
- preserve the objective and completed history while repairing the active open backlog in place
- keep the backlog sharp: one open frontier, explicit blocked follow-ons, and no umbrella tasks that bundle unrelated families
- preserve the same active seam on partial progress and only advance when acceptance is actually cleared or the seam must be split into explicit independent blockers
- default to `mini`, but escalate to `high` when the repair requires broader reseeding, dependency rewrites, or model-profile reclassification
- use graph summaries for `split|reseed` when graph support is enabled, but keep the full graph out of ordinary `ok|narrow` refreshes
- reseed broad work into graph-local slices and keep one actionable `open` task when a single next frontier is obvious
- keep downstream unmet-dependency tasks `blocked` instead of leaving them `open` for visibility
- not directly edit `RUNNER_STATE.json`, `RUNNER_EXEC_CONTEXT.json`, `RUNNER_HANDOFF.md`, or `.memory/runner/runtime/RUNNER_CYCLE_PREPARED.json`
- terminate immediately

No-progress recovery rule:
- if a cycle cannot produce durable progress, do not keep retrying the same broad task
- run `/prompts:run_govern`
- let `run_govern` tighten, split, or reseed the active backlog in place without clearing full runner memory
- prefer the smallest truthful recovery: tighten blocker first, split only when families are mixed, and reseed only when the task boundary is genuinely wrong
- treat coupling as a split trigger: if progress would require crossing into a second family or seam, stop widening and let `run_govern` keep that family separate in the next backlog shape

Graph support:
- graph generation is controller/script-owned and opt-in per repo via context-pack metadata
- `runctl --setup` may generate cached graph artifacts for supported repos, but prompts must never generate graph artifacts themselves
- full graph reasoning belongs to `/prompts:run_setup` and `/prompts:run_govern`, not normal execute cycles
- when graph support is unavailable or stale, runner behavior must fall back to the current non-graph flow without blocking startup

Fail-closed rules:
- do not hand off after a no-op inspection cycle
- if nothing concrete changed, narrow the blocker on the active seam first
- do not create `.memory/runner/locks/RUNNER_DONE.lock` while open seams remain
- if active work collapses to zero open seams without an explicit completed done-closeout frontier, synthesize or reopen one final done-closeout seam instead of inferring completion
- only write `.memory/runner/locks/RUNNER_DONE.lock` after that explicit done-closeout seam passes `run_gates`
- if final gates fail or cannot run, reopen closeout with one concrete blocker task and keep the infinite runner moving

## Runner Start Contract

`cl -> r=runner` and `cl loop <project>`:
- start an interactive Codex CLI pane
- resolve the active seam profile at the start of each cycle
- route `model_profile=mini` to the cheaper execution model and `model_profile=high` to `gpt-5.4` with `high`
- launch an internal controller per cycle
- controller dispatches `/prompts:run_execute ...` first
- after execute, controller scripts deterministic refresh itself with `runctl --setup` and `runctl --prepare-cycle` when no semantic update is needed
- when execute reports `needs_update=yes`, controller dispatches `/prompts:run_govern ...` in the same Codex session when that session already matches the requested update profile; otherwise it relaunches a fresh session for the required profile
- when scripted refresh fails to produce the prepared marker, controller likewise prefers same-session `/prompts:run_govern ...` to preserve execute context and only relaunches when the update profile is incompatible with the current session
- after govern, controller again scripts deterministic refresh itself with `runctl --setup` and `runctl --prepare-cycle`
- after scripted refresh or conditional update, controller exits the current Codex session so a fresh TUI session is launched for the next cycle
- the tmux-codex supervisor archives completed runner threads itself between cycles; prompts must not rely on `::archive`
- when setup refresh sees zero open seams but no completed explicit done-closeout seam, it must create or reopen one final closeout frontier instead of stopping
- the infinite runner should keep healing through seam repair, validation repair, and explicit closeout until completion is both semantically and operationally safe
- if a `mini` `run_govern` still cannot produce the prepared marker, controller retries `run_govern` on `high`
- if a `high` `run_govern` still cannot produce the prepared marker because no durable progress was recorded, controller queues a high-priority recovery triage task, refreshes state, and relaunches fresh on that recovery slice
- if that deterministic no-progress recovery still cannot refresh cleanly, or if the refresh failed for a different reason, controller stops in an explicit error state instead of hanging or spinning forever
- controller never dispatches setup or clear
