Use this command to govern infinite-runner state after one execute slice finishes.

This is the autonomous seam-governor prompt. It keeps the loop moving without wiping runner memory or rebuilding from scratch.

Runner context from `/prompts:run_govern` args:
- `DEV=$DEV`
- `PROJECT=$PROJECT`
- `RUNNER_ID=$RUNNER_ID`
- `PWD=$PWD`
- optional `PROJECT_ROOT=$PROJECT_ROOT`

## Scope First

Resolve target root in this order:
1. explicit `PWD`
2. explicit `PROJECT_ROOT`
3. explicit `PROJECT` via `$DEV/Repos/$PROJECT`
4. current working directory

`cd` to that root before doing anything else.

## Governing Contract

Read:
- `<target_root>/.memory/runner/OBJECTIVE.json`
- `<target_root>/.memory/runner/SEAMS.json`
- `<target_root>/.memory/runner/GAPS.json`
- `<target_root>/.memory/runner/RUNNER_EXEC_CONTEXT.json`
- `<target_root>/.memory/runner/RUNNER_ACTIVE_BACKLOG.json`
- graph summaries only when the active seam boundary is ambiguous:
  - `RUNNER_GRAPH_BOUNDARIES.json`
  - `RUNNER_GRAPH_HOTSPOTS.json`

This prompt owns semantic backlog repair and seam governance only. The controller will run deterministic `runctl --setup` and `runctl --prepare-cycle` after this prompt exits.

Strictness rules during govern:

- preserve the objective, runner identity/runtime enablement, and overall project direction
- treat `OBJECTIVE.json` as fixed intent, `SEAMS.json` as flexible plan, and the active seam as strict scope
- preserve the active seam by default until its acceptance is fully cleared
- do not widen the active seam just because execution found a tempting side quest
- every real discovered gap must end up classified in `GAPS.json` or folded into the active seam metadata; do not drop it on the floor
- if the discovered work blocks current seam correctness and still fits the same owner problem, merge it into the active seam
- if the discovered work blocks current seam correctness but needs a distinct owner problem or write set, create a prerequisite seam
- if the discovered work is real but non-blocking, defer it without preempting the active seam
- reject cosmetic or opportunistic cleanup that does not materially advance the objective
- keep the seam queue sharp: one actionable frontier, explicit blocked follow-ons, and no umbrella seams that bundle unrelated families
- preserve or strengthen acceptance and validation contracts; never relax them
- preserve `model_profile`, `touch_paths`, `validation_commands`, `deprecation_phase`, `fanout_risk`, and `coupling_notes` unless execution proved the seam boundary wrong
- preserve `parity_baseline_ref`, `parity_surface_ids`, `parity_audit_mode`, and `parity_harness_commands` by default
- if the active seam became too broad for one clean slice, split it into the smallest truthful child seams and keep only one child actionable
- if execution proved the active seam boundary wrong, reseed only the active open seam set in place; do not wipe completed history
- if graph artifacts exist, use them as evidence for `split` or prerequisite decisions before broad repo rescans
- if active work collapses to zero open seams but the objective has not yet passed explicit done-closeout `run_gates`, create or reopen exactly one closeout seam instead of allowing the runner to infer `done`
- do not directly edit `RUNNER_STATE.json`, `RUNNER_EXEC_CONTEXT.json`, `RUNNER_HANDOFF.md`, or `RUNNER_CYCLE_PREPARED.json` from this prompt

## Output

Keep output compact:
- `state_repaired=<yes|no>`
- `scope_status=<ok|narrow|split|reseed>`
- `decision=<continue_seam|complete_seam|split_seam|create_prereq_seam|defer_gaps_and_continue|objective_complete|halt>`
- `exiting=<yes>`

Terminate this Codex chat session immediately after govern finishes.
